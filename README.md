# Manage multiply mongodb connection via global var space in **NodeJS**

## Background

As using application vars in global space is tend to be an **anti-pattern**. You can find pretty much articles over the matter on the Internet. For instance, [Global Variables Are Bad](http://wiki.c2.com/?GlobalVariablesAreBad). Answers on Stackoverflow are mostly tells the same, here you go an example  
[Why are global variables considered bad practice? (node.js)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18635136/why-are-global-variables-considered-bad-practice-node-js) and so on and so forth. 

Thankfully, I came across [Singleton Pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?SingletonPattern) and another article with step by step walkthrough on implementation a singleton for node js. 

 [Creating A True Singleton In Node.js, With ES6 Symbols](https://derickbailey.com/2016/03/09/creating-a-true-singleton-in-node-js-with-es6-symbols/)

Leveraging ```Symbol``` helps to avoid pollution problem, implicit coupling, etc and build an API to work with applicationâ€™s global variables in pretty straight forward fashion. So my verion of singlenton to solve specific purpose I made after the reading.

PS. I pay great credits to the author of the article which brought myself to the solution. You saved my day, mate.

## Multiply mongodb connection

Apart of showing singleton pattern in actions I also pick up, per my mind, pretty frequently asking question. **How to make several connections to different mongodb databases using mongoose**. 
I am offering fully working end-to-end solution I elaborated for myself. I wrap it up into tiny express server for a showcase.

### Feedback

Hope the example may be useful, let me know your thoughts over the idea.
